/* Question: Write a function called corners that takes a matrix as an input argument and returns four outputs: the elements at its four 
corners in this order: top_left, top_right, bottom_left and bottom_right. (Note that loops and if-statements are neither necessary nor 
allowed as we have not covered them yet.) See an example run below:
>> [a, b, c, d] = corners([1 2; 3 4])
a =
     1
b =
     2
c =
     3
d =
     4 */
     
/* Solution */
function [top_left top_right bottom_left bottom_right] = corners(A)
top_left=A(1,1)
top_right=A(1,end)
bottom_left=A(end,1)
bottom_right=A(end,end)
