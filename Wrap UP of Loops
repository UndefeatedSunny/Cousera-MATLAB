Write a function called max_sum that takes v, a row vector of numbers, and n, a positive integer as inputs. The function needs to find the n consecutive elements of v whose sum is the largest possible. In other words, if v is [1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1] and n is 3, it will find 4 5 and 4 because their sum of 13 is the largest of any 3 consecutive elements of v. If multiple such sequences exist in v, max_sum returns the first one. The function returns summa, the sum as the first output argument and index, the index of the first element of the n consecutive ones as the second output. If the input n is larger than the number of elements of v, the function returns 0 as the sum and -1 as the index. Here are a few example runs: 
[summa, index] = max_sum([1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1],3)
    summa = 13 
    index = 4
[summa, index] = max_sum([1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1],2) 
    summa = 9 
    index = 4
[summa, index] = max_sum([1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1],1) 
    summa = 5 
    index = 5
[summa, index] = max_sum([1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1],9) 
    summa = 25 
    index = 1
[summa, index] = max_sum([1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1],10) 
    summa = 0 
    index = -1 
    
    
    /* Solution */
    function [summa index]= max_sum(v,n)
maxv=0;
ind=-1;
if n>size(v,2)
    summa=0
    index=-1
else
    for i=1:n
        maxv=sum(v(1:n));
        ind=1;
    end
    for j=2:(size(v,2)-n+1)
        total=0;
        total=sum(v(j:(j+n-1)));
        if total>maxv
            maxv=total;
            ind=j;
        else
            continue;
        end
    end
end
summa =maxv
index=ind
