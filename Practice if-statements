/* Question: Write a function called picker that takes three input arguments called condition, in1 and in2 in this order. The argument condition is a logical. If it is true, the function assigns the value of in1 to the output argument out,  otherwise, it assigns the value of in2 to out. See the examples below to see how picker works in practice.
a = 2;
b = 3;
picker(a<b,a,b)
ans =
     2
picker(a<0,1,-1)
ans =
     -1   */
     
     /* Solution */
     
function out = picker(condition,in1,in2)
if condition>0
    out=in1
else
    out=in2
end
