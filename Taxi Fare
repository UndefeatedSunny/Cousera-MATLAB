/* Question: Write a function called taxi_fare that computes the fare of a taxi ride. It takes two inputs: the distance in kilometers (d) 
and the amount of wait time in minutes (t). The fare is calculated like this: 
the first km is $5 
every additional km is $2 
and every minute of waiting is $0.25. 
Once a km is started, it counts as a whole (Hint: consider the ceil built-in function). The same rule applies to wait times. 
You can assume that d >0 and t >= 0 but they are not necessarily integers. The function returns the fare in dollars. 
For example, a 3.5-km ride with 2.25 minutes of wait costs $11.75. Note that loops and if-statements are neither necessary nor allowed.*/

/* Solution*/
function fare=taxi_fare(d,t)
fare=5+(2*(ceil(d)-1))+(0.25*ceil(t))
