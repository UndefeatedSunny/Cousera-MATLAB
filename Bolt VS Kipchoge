/* Question: 1- As of early 2018, Usain Bolt holds the world record in the men's 100-meter dash. It is 9.58 seconds. What was his average 
                speed in km/h? Assign the result to a variable called hundred.
             2- Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge set a new world record for men of 2:01:39 on September 16, 2018. Assign his average speed in km/h to
                the variable marathon. The marathon distance is 42.195 kilometers. */
                
/* Solution */
hundred = 1800/(5*9.58)
disp(hundred)
marathon = 42.195/(7299/3600)
disp(marathon)
