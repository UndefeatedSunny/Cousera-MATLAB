A sparse matrix is a large matrix with almost all elements of the same value (typically zero). The normal representation of a sparse matrix takes up lots of memory when the useful information can be captured with much less. A possible way to represent a sparse matrix is with a cell vector whose first element is a 2-element vector representing the size of the sparse matrix. The second element is a scalar specifying the default value of the sparse matrix. Each successive element of the cell vector is a 3-element vector representing one element of the sparse matrix that has a value other than the default. The three elements are the row index, the column index and the actual value. Write a function called sparse2matrix that takes a single input of a cell vector as defined above and returns the output argument called matrix, the matrix in its traditional form. Consider the following run:
cellvec = {[2 3], 0, [1 2 3], [2 2 -3]};
matrix = sparse2matrix(cellvec)
matrix =
     0     3     0
     0    -3     0
     
/* Solution */

function matrix = sparse2matrix(cellvec)
sizecell=numel(cellvec);
default = cellvec{1,2}*ones(cellvec{1,1}(1,:));
for i=3:sizecell
    row=cellvec{1,i}(1);
    col=cellvec{1,i}(2);
    val=cellvec{1,i}(3);
    default(row,col)=val;
end
matrix=default;
